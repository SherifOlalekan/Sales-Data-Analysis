My recommendations is as follows;
- Invest in marketing and promotion during peak sales hours and months (especially during the festive periods) to maximize revenue.
- There should be focus on promoting products in cities with low turnovers.
- Market and customers survey should be conducted in cities with low sales to determine the interest of the locals and their standard of living.
